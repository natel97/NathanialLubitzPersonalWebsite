		<p>&emsp; &emsp; Hello, my name is Nathanial Lubitz! I'm currently going to Central Lakes College and working towards an Associates Degree in Mobile
			Application Development. It's a two year program that teaches students the basics on creating websites, iPhone and Android Apps, 
			and working with Microsoft and Oracle Databases.</p>
			<br>
			<h4>A little about me.</h4>
		<p>&emsp; &emsp; I graduated in 2016 from Frazee High School in Frazee, MN. I was in Track for 5 years, cross country for 4 years, the musical for 
			three years, and wrestling for 2 years. I tried to be involved with my school as well as be a leader in my community. I worked at the
			local gas station for two years before moving off to College in Brainerd, MN. I then began my classes and started working at Olive 
			Garden for my first semester. I quit in order to prepare for my second semester in which I was taking 24 credits in order to 
			graduate sooner. I hope to begin working in the field as early as this summer. My instructor gave me the go-ahead to finish my 
			classes online via a webex presentation.</p>
			<br>
		<p> &emsp; &emsp; I try to keep progressing myself in as many directions as possible. Some of my hobbies are music composition, singing, 
			running, as well as anything to do with computers. I enjoy challenging myself to work towards the ideal in every way possible. Someday, I hope 
			to complete a marathon just for fun! I don't really see myself going anywhere in music, it's just a hobby that I enjoy. As far as computers, 
			I really enjoy programming software, putting together the hardware, troubleshooting my computer problems (often solved by a simple reboot, haha) 
			and learning new skills.</p>
