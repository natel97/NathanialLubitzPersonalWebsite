		<p>&emsp; &emsp; Hello, my name is Nathanial Lubitz! I'm currently going to Central Lakes College and working towards an Associates Degree in Mobile
			Application Development. It's a two year program that teaches students how to create websites, iPhone and Android Apps, 
			and Microsoft and Oracle Databases.</p>
			<br>
			<h4>A little about me.</h4>
			<p>&emsp; &emsp; I graduated in 2016 from Frazee High School in Frazee, MN. I was in track, cross country, the musicals, 
				and wrestling. I tried to be involved with my school as well as be a leader in my community. I worked at the
				local gas station for two years before moving off to college in Brainerd, MN. I then began my classes and started working at Olive 
				Garden for my first semester. My second semester I chose to focus on my studies as I was taking 24 credits in order to 
				graduate sooner. My instructor gave me the go-ahead to finish my classes online.</p>
				<br>
				<p> &emsp; &emsp; I try to keep progressing myself in as many directions as possible. Some of my hobbies are music composition, singing, 
					running, as well as anything to do with computers. I enjoy challenging myself to work towards the ideal in every way possible. Someday, I hope 
					to complete a marathon just for fun! As far as computers, 
					I really enjoy programming software, putting together the hardware, troubleshooting my computer problems (often solved by a simple reboot, haha) 
					and learning new skills.</p>
